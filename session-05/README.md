# 05. Correctness of Distributed Systems
## Debugging, Testing, Profiling, Tracing

This session deals with dynamic code analysis.
We talk about debugging, testing, profiling and tracing in Go.

Two main areas:

- program correctness
- program performance

The lecture focuses mainly on program correctness, while we will also deal with
program performance in the hands-on part.

## Outline

- Challenges of Distributed Systems
- Formal Methods
- Testing
- Tools: Debugging, Tracing, Profiling

## [Slides](slides/05-Correctness.pdf)

## Readings
- Go Web Programming chapter 9

### Questions
